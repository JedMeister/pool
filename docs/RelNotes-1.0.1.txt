====================
v1.0.1 Release Notes
====================

* Added support for keeping the pool in a Git repository

  Why?

  Keeping the pool inside a Git repository (e.g., an autocommitted
  repository) is useful because:
  
  1) it allows us to rollback pool operations
  2) it makes it much easier to backup a pool
  
  How?

  - when we initialize the pool gitignore non-essential files

    Note that users of existing pools will need to manually setup
    gitignore and anchor files.

  - we ignore link-less stocks that could be left in-place when we
    checkout an old commit that undos a pool registration.

* pyproject magic import hook related changes

  - created Pool high-level class for direct access via API
    (we moved a lot of logic that was previously in cli code)

  - ported pool to use verseek API directly instead of CLI

* made working with multiple pools more intuitive

  - if $(pwd)/.pool exists, prefer $(pwd) to POOL_DIR

    More intuitive and convenient since we can set POOL_DIR and
    still access other pools without messing with POOL_DIR environment
    variable.

  - pool-init should initialize pool in CWD if POOL_DIR already initialized

* bugfix: checkout should clean up stale tags

* ported to pyproject 1.0

* minor packaging changes
