v1.0 Release Notes
==================

* root can operate on non-root owned pools safely
  implemented using a transparent privilege dropping mechanism

* improved automatic garbage collection: when you unregister a stock, binary packages from that
  stock are deleted from the pool automatically (previously you had to run pool-gc)

* new pool-info options:
  --stock-sources (previously --source-versions): shows all source packages/versions in stocks
  --stock-binaries: shows all binary packages/versions in stocks

  These options allows the user to find which stock a package came from.

* support udeb type packages

* support epochs in package versions

* developed exhaustive regression test suite (tests/regtest.sh)
  syntax: ./regtest.sh [ --options ]
  
    If no testing options are specified - test everything
  
  Options:
    --pool=PATH  use previously initialized pool
                 (e.g., initialize a pool with --notests --nodelete)
  
    --notests    turn off tests
    --nodelete   dont delete test pool at the end
                 (default if test fails)
  
    --info       test pool-info
    --list       test pool-list
    --exists     test pool-exists
    --commit     test new version detection after committing to stocks
    --getnew     test pool-get of newest versions
    --getall     test pool-get of all versions (new and old)
    --gc         test garbage collection
  
* developed optimized cached control file retrieval mechanism (debinfo)

* bugfixes:
  Pool.resolve calls _list without all_versions argument and this broke pool-get
  sumo-close on unregister + dup thin branch into stock/checkout
  registering a subpool breaks package building
  subpool unregistration broken because Sumo arena in checkout/ wasn't closed
